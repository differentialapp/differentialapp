## About
This is a tool designed to help medical learners use statistical tools like likelihood ratios in a more streamlined way.  With this, you can just select a couple of diagnosis, select a pre-test probability, and then select a test with a likelihood ratio, and the post-test probability is calculator for you using Bayesian statistics.

The database was created from multiple sources, mostly by hand.  Part of it was shared by GetTheDiagnosis.org, which is much appreciated.
